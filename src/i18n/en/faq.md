#### <span id="1" type="question">1. What is the "EFTG"?</span>
EFTG Project Background Information:

In order to promote cross-border investment and provide investors with easy access to regulated information, a need got identified to develop a system that offers a single view of the information published by listed companies in EU currently stored at different Member States' infrastructures.  The Transparency Directive 2004/109/EC aim to two major achievements in this regard: a single European format to structure electronic documents, and a European Electronic Access Point (EEAP). As regards the format, the Commission adopted in December 2018 a Regulation which will impose from 2020 the Xhtml format for all the annual financial reports published by companies, and for companies preparing consolidated financial statements, the structuring of around 700 data points using inline XBRL. As regards the EEAP, the Directorate General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union of the European Commission (EC / FISMA) is developing a European Financial Transparency Gateway (EFTG) pilot project. Phase I of the EFTG led to the development of a successful Proof of Concept (PoC) where the feasibility of using blockchain technologies got demonstrated. Phase II of the EFTG Pilot Project consists in developing a blockchain platform infrastructure technically enabling citizens and investors by giving them increased accessibility to public regulated information provided by the participating Officially Appointed Mechanisms (OAM). The EFTG Pilot Project also aims to provide search capability among real Member States' data, such as those from the Annual Financial Reports (AFR) in order to help contribute to further integrated capital markets. The Blockchain Competence Centre (BLKCC) of the European Commission (EC Luxembourg) came up with a new approach to build a distributed and decentralized platform system tailored to the EFTG needs using a tailored version of the existing and successful Steem Blockchain by extending its capabilities and functionalities. In terms of benefits to end-users, the platform system should demonstrate that it will allow a cooperative approach of players involved, provide easier cross-border access to regulated information, lower the search time and reduce the information access costs while preserving the possibility to propose additional value-added data services. It is expected that with the blockchain architecture, investors will obtain faster results for the information searched because they will no longer have to go through 28 different portals but rather to a single entry point from a single distributed framework across the EU, and data ownership will be retained by their rightful data owners. In addition, the new system will be zero-downtime, fault-tolerant as well as DDoS-resistant.

#### <span id="2" type="question">2. What are the prospects of the EFTG to be in use in the future? Will there be any concrete outcomes? Will the project affect my organisation?</span>
The Pilot project aims to demonstrate the feasibility and added value of using a blockchain for the shared storage and dissemination of regulated information among the OAMs.  In the short term, it does not commit any party (OAM, EC, ESMA...) to pursue the construction of the EEAP on such a basis.

This project should potentially guide the Union towards the implementation of a European Electronic Access Point (EEAP), as per respective legislation (Directive 2004/109/EC, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/14374). **If retained as a viable solution for the EEAP, the EFTG will become a point of reference for the parties developing the EEAP and related legislation.**

Beyond their contribution in terms of data and technical support to the Pilot, the OAMs will be consulted in parallel on the prospects of a future deployment of the EFTG as the EEAP, including on governance issues.

#### <span id="3" type="question">3. When will the EFTG Pilot be delivered?</span>
The EFTG Pilot is intended to be delivered by end of Q1 2019.

Following from phase 1 in which a Proof of Concept was successfully developed to demonstrate the feasibility of using Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) to interconnect (virtually) decentralized Officially Appointed Mechanisms' (OAM) databases, phase 2 of the EFTG project will pilot the integration of OAMs' systems using actual data using close to real life scenarios. 

As such, the EFTG pilot, if it proves successful, could represent the premise of the EEAP to be implemented by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

The Pilot (phase 2) is already in progress and is expected to be completed by end of Q1 2019. 

**After this time point, participating OAMs will be consulted to gather feedback and a discussion will take place in the presence of FISMA and ESMA whether the EFTG Pilot could be utilised as foundations for implementing the EEAP.**

#### <span id="4" type="question">4. Who is involved in the EFTG, and what is each one's role?</span>

The EFTG pilot project is a joint interdepartmental initiative of two European Commission General Directorates (DGs):

1. DG FISMA represented by Alain Deckers, Jean Philippe Rabine and Emmanouil Filippakis.
2. DG DIGIT represented by Sorin Cristescu, Christophe Delogne and Elias Michelioudakis.

OAMs (Officially Appointed Mechanisms) have been also invited to participate to the pilot in order to capture their feedback as users and enable real data usage.

#### <span id="5" type="question">5. Does my organisation need to participate in the project? What options are there?</span>

OAMs are cordially invited to participate to the EFTG Pilot. Such involvement remains voluntary. 

- **During the Pilot Phase, there are 4 options:**
  1. **OBSERVER:**
    - This is a read-only role with no actual involvement and decisioning with the blockchain-based solution design.
  2. **BASIC USER LEVEL:**
    - Access to a light client (basic web interface) is being supplied to enable your organisation to upload manually some data onto the blockchain platform.
    - DIGIT will by default run and maintain blockchain platform nodes on your behalf.
  3. **REGULAR USER LEVEL:**
    - Opportunity to upload manually some data onto the blockchain platform.
    - Opportunity for you to install and run within your systems one or several virtual machine nodes as part of the blockchain platform.
    - Technical assistance will be provided by DIGIT to help your organisation install and run nodes (installation kit supplied by DIGIT to your organisation).
    - A light client (basic interface) will be supplied to enable your organisation to upload data manually onto the blockchain platform.
    - Opportunity to be involved actively in the blockchain pilot project by hosting one or several nodes - hereby helping with the resilience, availability and security of the network.
  4. **ADVANCED USER LEVEL:**
    - Opportunity to upload manually some data onto the blockchain platform.
    - Opportunity for your organisation to install and run within your systems one or several virtual machines node as part of the blockchain platform. 
    - Such nodes would be of different types which will contribute significantly to the functionality, resilience, availability and security of the network.
    - Technical assistance will be provided by DIGIT to help install blockchain platform nodes (installation kit can be supplied to your organisation).
    - Data integration will be based on provision by DIGIT of relevant programming libraries (python / .js). This would enable your organisation to become independent, hereby writing your own scripts to pull data from current databases (or write your own data portals), and creating blockchain transactions yourself. 
    - Beyond an active involvement in the blockchain pilot project by hosting one or several nodes, your organisation would have the additional opportunity to contribute further to shaping the Pilot in certain areas - hereby helping with the design, resilience, availability and security of the network.

#### <span id="6" type="question">6. Should I have any further questions, who may I contact?</span>

Should you have any questions at this stage, please feel free to contact us directly using this email address: [FISMA-EFTG-PROJECT@ec.europa.eu](FISMA-EFTG-PROJECT@ec.europa.eu)

Besides, the European Commission (EC) encourages all actors (including OAMs) to collaborate using defined communication channels within a technology called "SLACK": ([www.slack.com](https://www.slack.com)). All active participants are being provided with login details to join Slack and the ([eftg.slack.com](https://eftg.slack.com)). Four channels have already been created:
  1. **\#general**
    
    This channel contains general information about the EFTG Pilot project that will be added iteratively as the project progresses. e.g. how to access the EFTG web interface; how to use the pre-alpha EFTG front-end interface; etc. 
    This channel will also be used for general communication and discussion about the pilot. 
  2. **\#oam** 
    
    This channel is tailored for OAMs to dialogue between each other, as well as for communicating with the Commission concerning the conduct of the project.
  3. **\#random** 
    
    This channel is created for any other miscellaneous items that do not fall under the other two channels created so far. e.g. any other subject, including out of project's scope.
  4. **\#technical** 
    
    This channel is designed to answer technical questions.

#### <span id="7" type="question">7. What does the solution architecture looks like?</span>

#### <span id="8" type="question">8. What are the EFTG Pilot deliverables?</span>

The main deliverables of the EFTG Pilot will include: 
1. A pilot distributed ledger technology (DLT) infrastructure allowing data sharing with two distinct use case scenarios:
  a. Use Case 1: Enabling an investor to search financial information based on existing OAMs input data provided by the participating OAMs. Such data will consist of pre-selected information or metrics in relation to companies' regulated information. An interface enabling OAMs to manually enter such input data.
  b. Use case 2: Enabling an investor to search financial information using extended EEAP-taxonomy and including searching for data which could be considered by OAMs to be made available to investors only through a subscription plan.
2. Basic user-focused web interfaces as follows:
  a. Use Case 1: An interface comprising a search and display of data to be used typically by an investor in the way foreseen by the existing legislation for the electronic access point. 
  b. Use case 2: An interface comprising a search and display of data to be used typically by an investor, including advanced features in line with potential business models for OAMs such as an extension of the EEAP-based taxonomy, alongside the opportunity for an investor to subscribe to a series of documents.
3. The integration of data currently disseminated by the OAMs, with varying degrees proposed. 
4. Documentation for the OAMs to install and operate the DLT components and respective support.

#### <span id="9" type="question">9. Can I upload zip file on the EFTG platform?</span>

Yes - the EFTG platform enable upload of any kind of document, either through bulk upload or via the EFTG Data Entry portal. 

#### <span id="10" type="question">10. Can the EFTG Pilot project enable uploading of data formats other than pdf?</span>

Yes. The EFTG Pilot project aimed at delivering a solution that would enable OAMs to upload REAL documents (hence why the "Pilot" definition), for Investors to use in turn. The majority of OAMs shared with us that they are currently storing their data in a pdf format, even if the XBRL format should become a standard within the next couple of years.
As a conclusion, the team has developed the EFTG Pilot Data Entry Portal so that pdf, xbrl and other types of documents can actually be stored on the platform. Nonetheless, only a pdf preview reader has been developed in the EFTG Pilot Investor Search Portal. Xbrl preview or other files preview could therefore constitute an extension of the Pilot.

#### <span id="11" type="question">11. Can the EFTG platform allow documents' corrections?</span>

Yes, this capability is built-in.

#### <span id="12" type="question">12. Is the EFTG Pilot project compliant with GDPR?</span>

Yes. The DPO from the European Commission has been involved early in the project about this matter.

#### <span id="13" type="question">13. Do I have to install and run a node in order to participate to the Pilot project by uploading real documents?</span>

No. An OAM is not required to install and run a node as part of the EFTG blockchain network in order to upload real documents on the EFTG platform. In order to upload documents, all OAMs must nonetheless contact the project team via Slack [eftg.slack.com](https://eftg.slack.com) in order to being provided with a login.

#### <span id="14" type="question">14. Can the platform enable a deep link to an OAM website?</span>

Yes this is possible. Nonetheless, it is recommended to use the prescribed distributed architecture for data files storage as part of the blockchain platform for both a higher resilience and data availability from a customer's benefit.

#### <span id="15" type="question">15. What is the advantage of running an RPC node?</span>

Having installed and running an RPC node gives you the following opportunities:
- You can create and run your own web portal using your own domain rather than relying on the ones provided by the EU Commission. This can be particularly interesting if you decide to accommodate your own specific requirements and design in your portals, or should you decide to create a portal in a different language for example.
- You can decide to allow other consortium members to connect their portals to your RPC node.
- You can use your RPC node to upload documents in bulk without necessitating any connection to the EU Commission's RPC or any other RPC.
