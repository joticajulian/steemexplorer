# Serey Explorer
Serey explorer is a client-side block explorer for steem-like blockchains. It uses Steem-JS API to query users, posts, and transactions directly to the seed nodes.

Announcement:
[https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@jga/steem-explorer-based-on-steem-js-1539631316061](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@jga/steem-explorer-based-on-steem-js-1539631316061)

## Config
Change the configuration file `src/config.js` with the symbols and rpc_node of the blockchain.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run serve

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
